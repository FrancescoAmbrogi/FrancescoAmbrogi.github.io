abstract="Pressure-induced flow separation, which occurs in the presence of a strong adverse pressure gradient, is very common in many physical systems, ranging from the medical field, to engineering applications, to the natural sciences. In most of the practical applications the pressure gradient varies both spatially and temporally giving rise to a transient separation process often associated with a drop in performance of many systems (e.g. wings, turbomachinery).",
