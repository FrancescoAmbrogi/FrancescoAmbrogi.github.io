It includes a study of the basic fluid properties, hydrostatics and the fundamental equations of fluid motion. The control volume concept is introduced and applied to the continuity, momentum, and energy equations. Appropriate simplifications result in the Bernoulli equation that is used for practical applications. Students are initiated to dimensional analysis and similitude. An introduction to the concepts of boundary layer for laminar and turbulent flows is given. Viscous flow understanding is then applied to the empirical calculation of incompressible flow in pipes. Finally, the students are exposed to the analysis of open channel flows, as well as an introduction to pumps. The lectures are supplemented by problem assignments and experiments conducted in the laboratory, including measurement of pressure and hydrostatic pressures on submerged surfaces, velocity and flow rates, and weirs.\nInstructor Francesco Ambrogi Course structure The course is structured in the following way:\nAssignments (5) 5% Midterm exam 30% Laboratories 15% Final exam 50% Course materials Download the Course Syllabus HERE\nRequired textbook: Fluid Mechanics, Seventh Edition, F. White (McGraw Hill)\nSuggested time commitment Generally, we expect that students attend all lectures (3hrs/week), review material at home (1 hr/week), complete the weekly assignment problems (1-2 hrs/week - if an assignment takes much more than 1 hr you should be doing additional problems and coming to tutorials and office hours for additional help understanding, about another 2 hours a week). If you keep up your understanding week to week, then a few hours review should be enough to do well on the final exam. An average student will be able to do well in this course by spending about 6 hours a week, over the twelve-week term.\nStudents feedback Student A Greatly enjoyed the general mood of the class, as it wasn’t too serious and monotone but also not too loose where it was difficult to learn. Some other classes moods feel very monotone where I would not be excited to attend class but it was not the case for this class where I would actually look forward to attending class. Instructor was also very open to helping students and I was never discouraged against asking for help.\nStudent B Coming in to this course I was dreading it, I thought it was going to be extremely difficult and I would hate having a course where the sum of all forces does not equal zero but with him fluids was cool and fun an I genuinely looked forward to coming to class and learning new things.\nStudent C The way the course notes are built in front of us and then posted to Moodle is very useful because It keeps us engaged during class, but if you miss class it is easy to catch up on material. The ratio of tutorial to lecture was good. We went over a lot of examples in class which was helpful. Most times, the instructor put emphasis on what was important by starting lectures with a review of the concepts seen in the previous lecture. Finally, the professor created an environment where students were comfortable in asking questions and he always find a way to explain concepts in a different manner to make sure everyone understood.\n","date":1693526400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1693526400,"objectID":"8141e5c84a8d8412f23ccd3db6a54706","permalink":"https://FrancescoAmbrogi.github.io/courses/fluid-dynamics-mee315/","publishdate":"2023-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/fluid-dynamics-mee315/","section":"courses","summary":"A third year undergraduate engineering course on the fundamentals of Fluid Dynamics","tags":["previous"],"title":"Fluid Dynamics - Royal Military College of Canada F23","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Table of Contents What you will learn Instructor Pre-requisite knowledge Course materials Suggested time commitment Students feedback What you will learn This is an introductory course in fluid mechanics.

He was very accommodating and his passion for the subject made me want to learn more, something no other Queen’s professor has accomplished. He inspired me to switch out of biomechanical and into general mechanical so that I can take fluids again next year. I hope he continues to teach fluids so that MECH 241 doesn’t have to be the class everyone is scared of failing.\nStudent B Honestly hearing it was your first year I didn’t know what to expect, especially hearing what happened in this class. But let me tell you, YOU’VE BEEN AMAZING. Seriously, I was really concerned about the course but the way you deliver materiel is insane. Please become a permanent professor. You’re a god at what you do.\nStudent C Professor Ambrogi is single handedly the best professor and one of the best teachers I have had in my learning career. You can tell he cares about the content as well as his students success. The structure of his classes are engaging and effective for my style of learning, the assignments are the right amount of challenge and time commitment and the rest of the course videos and practice he provides is perfect. I really appreciate his summary videos.

Turbulence models for the steady or unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations (RANS and URANS, respectively) are commonly used in industry; however, their performance is often unsatisfactory. The comparison of RANS results with experimental data does not clearly isolate the modelling errors, since differences with the data may be due to a combination of modelling and numerical errors, and also to possible differences in the boundary conditions.  In the present study we us high-fidelity Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) results to carry out a consistent evaluation of the turbulence models.  By using the same numerical scheme and boundary conditions as the LES, and a grid on which grid convergence was achieved, we can isolate modelling erors. The calculations (both LES and RANS) are carried out using a well-validated, second-order accurate code. Separation is generated by imposing a freestream velocity distribution, that is modulated in time.  We examined three frequencies (a rapid, flutter-like oscillations, an intermediate one in which the forcing and the flow have the same timescales, and a quasi-steady one).  We also considered three different pressure distributions, one with alternating Favourable and Adverse Pressure Gradients (FPG and APG, respectively), one oscillating between an APG and a zero-pressure gradient (ZPG) and one with an oscillating APG.}  All turbulence models capture the general features of this complex unsteady flow as well or better than in similar steady cases. The presence, during the cycle, of times in which the freestream pressure gradient is close to zero affects significantly the model performance. Comparing our results with those in the literature indicates that numerical errors due to the type of discretization and to the grid resolution are as significant as those due to the turbulence model.","tags":["turbulence"],"title":"Evaluation of Turbulence Models in Unsteady Separation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["F.

The unsteadiness was generated by imposing an oscillating, wall-normal velocity profile at the top of the computational domain, and a range of reduced frequencies ($k$), from a very rapid flutter-like motion to a slow quasi-steady oscillation, was studied. Ambrogi et al. [J. Fluid Mech. 945, A10, 2022] showed that the reduced frequency greatly affects the transient separation process, and at a frequency $k = 1$, the separation region became unstable and was advected periodically out of the domain. In this paper we will discuss the causes of the observed advection process and the effects of the unsteadiness on the second moments. The time evolution of turbulent kinetic energy, for instance, reveals that an advection-like phenomenon is also present at a very low reduced frequency, but its dynamic behaviour is completely different from that of the intermediate frequency ($k = 1$). At the intermediate frequency the entire recirculation region is advected downstream, keeping its shape. The advected structure is rotational in nature, and moves at constant speed. In contrast, in the low- frequency case the advected fluid originates at the reattachment point, and the structure is shear-dominated. Particle pathlines reflect the fact that the flow at the low frequency is quasi-steady-state, but show peculiar differences at the intermediate frequency, in which the flow response to the freestream forcing depends on the particle positions in the wall-normal direction.","tags":["turbulence"],"title":"Characterization of unsteady separation in a turbulent boundary layer: Reynolds stresses and flow dynamics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Francesco Ambrogi"],"categories":["Rotaract"],"content":"Overview My journey in Rotaract in Canada begun on April 2021 when I joined the Rotaract Club of Kingston as a regular member.

The unsteadiness is prescribed by imposing an oscillating suction–blowing velocity profile at the top boundary of the computational domain. The alternating favourable and adverse pressure gradients cause the flow to separate and reattach to the wall periodically. A range of reduced frequencies $k$ was investigated, spanning from a very rapid flutter-like motion to a slow, quasi-steady flapping. The Reynolds number based on the boundary-layer displacement thickness $\\delta_o^\\star$ at the inflow plane is $Re^\\star=1000$. Both time- and phase-averaged fields are analysed and results are compared with steady conditions. The reduced frequency $k$ has a significant effect on the transient flow-separation process. For high $k$ the separation bubble does not grow as thick as in the corresponding steady case, but the length of the bubble remains comparable; hysteresis is observed in the near-wall region. As $k$ is reduced, a threshold is met at which the separation bubble grows in the wall-normal direction. However, the length of the bubble is significantly reduced again when compared with the steady case. At this frequency, the region of slow-moving fluid generated by the flow reversal is advected downstream, causing a decorrelation between the forcing (the imposed free-stream velocity) and the velocity and pressure downstream of the separation bubble. Moreover, hysteresis effects are shifted away from the wall. At the lowest frequency a quasi-steady solution is approached; however, transient effects are still present in the backflow region.","tags":["turbulence"],"title":"Characterization of unsteady separation in a turbulent boundary layer: mean and phase-averaged flow","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Francesco Ambrogi"],"categories":["University"],"content":"Overview Presented on an annual basis, this award recognizes a teaching assistant of Mechanical Engineering for their contribution to the undergraduate class as voted by all years (2nd , 3rd and 4th ).\nI want to extend my profound gratitude to my wife Veronica, who has the courage to stand by my side every single day, to everyone in the Department, including my supervisor Prof. Piomelli and my fellow colleagues at the TSM-Lab, and to every instructor I have had the pleasure to work with.\n","date":1657670400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1657670400,"objectID":"4c1e813bba1809760e11303698e26a94","permalink":"https://FrancescoAmbrogi.github.io/post/bwa_award/","publishdate":"2022-07-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/bwa_award/","section":"post","summary":"On May 2022 I received the 2022 Bronze Wrench award.","tags":["Academic"],"title":"I was awarded the 2022 Bronze Wrench Award by the MME Department.","type":"post"},{"authors":["Francesco Ambrogi","Ugo Piomelli","David E.

On an airfoil, for instance, the variation of angle of attack induces unsteadiness in the pressure gradient which greatly affects the flow physics and the airfoil behavior. The fast-changing body curvature of a shark swimming and maneuvering generates strong pressure gradients which, of course, are space and time dependent. Numerical simulation of such case studies is extremely important to increase our physical understanding of separated flows and improve future modeling capabilities.\nIn the present project, the large eddy simulation (LES) technique is used to investigate a turbulent boundary layer under unsteady pressure gradient generated by imposing a suction-blowing velocity profile at the top boundary. The adverse pressure gradient is strong enough to generate a separated flow. The non dimensional parameter which characterizes the unsteadiness is the reduced frequency $\\widetilde{k}$ defined as:\n$$ \\widetilde{k} = \\frac{\\pi f L_{PG}}{U_{o}} $$\nWhere $f$ is the imposed frequency, $L_{PG}$ is the length over which the Pressure Gradient varies, and $U_{o}$ is the free-stream velocity at the inflow plane. Several cases have been investigated over a range of reduced frequency and compared with the steady cases at the same pressure gradient.\nSimulations are performed using a well validated code, with second order differences for all terms, semi-implicit time advancement, and MPI parallelization. The unresolved stresses are modeled using the Vreman eddy viscosity model.\nThe animation shows contours of the instantaneous streamwise velocity $u$ for a reduced frequency of 10, 1 and 0.2 respectively. The animation clearly shows the differences between the two cases: when f is high enough the separation bubble does not have time to develop, yet the size of the separation region is comparable to a steady case. When $k$ decreases, the extent of the separation bubble in the wall normal direction increases but the length of the separation region is reduced compared with the steady case.\n","date":1628899200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628899200,"objectID":"ddc8498dab1c9182f3d975cd20184cd8","permalink":"https://FrancescoAmbrogi.github.io/project/uapgtbl/","publishdate":"2021-08-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/uapgtbl/","section":"project","summary":"Unsteady Pressure Gradient Turbulent Boundary Layer Simulation","tags":["Turbulence"],"title":"UAPG-TBL Simulation","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1618704000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618704000,"objectID":"4be912806a7293f8db77645774c5f0b9","permalink":"https://FrancescoAmbrogi.github.io/project/pyn/","publishdate":"2021-04-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/pyn/","section":"project","summary":"An undergraduate level set of Numerical Analysis problems using Python.

Hundreds of studends from everywhere in the world have the chance to work together in Teams to collaboratively tackle the world’s most important challenges as defined by the United Nations.\nAs it is well described in the linkedIn page, HTCTW has three main aims:\nExpand the availability and increase the accessibility of our learning journey.\nSupport universities and colleges to integrate our experiential learning into their curriculum.\nSupport the growing community of alumni and partners with implementing real change.\nI have to say that the pandemic put all of us through a lot of challenges, but it also gave rise to new opportunities. In these 5 days of intense learning experience I have seen students from all over the world, working together in teams, and brainstorming wonderful ideas to tackle the development goals. This has absolutely NO price!!\nThank you HTCTW, it was both an honor and a pleasure to be part of the community.\n","date":1613779200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1613779200,"objectID":"35da3c5b75519be850c4b51cb99e4a23","permalink":"https://FrancescoAmbrogi.github.io/post/htctw/","publishdate":"2021-02-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/htctw/","section":"post","summary":"I took part to the How To Change the World program (Feb 2021 edition) as teaching assistant.","tags":["Academic"],"title":"I joined How To Change The World program as teaching assistant for the February 2021 edition","type":"post"},{"authors":["Francesco Ambrogi"],"categories":["University"],"content":"Overview Within the TSM Lab, my collegues and I study the fascinating problem of Turbulent Flows. I have always been captured by turbulence. Sometimes I found myself staring at the flames in a fireplace wondering how someone can even try to predict the behavior of flames themselves or the motion of smoke and plumes. Working in this group is a wonderful opportunity to satisfy my deep curiosity. Day by day I am unlocking new physical and mathematical features of turbulent flows that make this problem scary and fascinating at the same time.\nIn the following years I will investigate the physics of turbulent boundary layers under the effect of strong pressure gradients.\n","date":1611014400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1611014400,"objectID":"53729f5d851d7ec393b88f5a671f45a2","permalink":"https://FrancescoAmbrogi.github.io/post/tsm_joined/","publishdate":"2021-01-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/tsm_joined/","section":"post","summary":"Starting September 2019 I joined the TSM Lab at Queen's University as a Research Assistant.","tags":["Academic"],"title":"I joined the Turbulence Simulation and Modelling (TSM) Lab","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\nFeatures Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides Controls Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;) Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne Two Three A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\nclass: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\nOnly the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view Themes black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} Custom CSS Example Let’s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; } Questions?
