Learners must have completed the prerequisite course (APSC 111 - Physics) or a similar course.\nCourse materials Download the Course Syllabus HERE\nRequired textbook: Fundamentals of Fluid Mechanics, Seventh Edition, Munson (Wiley)\nSuggested time commitment Generally, we expect that students attend all lectures (3hrs/week), review material at home (1 hr/week), complete the weekly assignment problems (1-2 hrs/week - if an assignment takes much more than 1 hr you should be doing additional problems and coming to tutorials and office hours for additional help understanding, about another 2 hours a week). If you keep up your understanding week to week, then a few hours review should be enough to do well on the final exam. An average student will be able to do well in this course by spending about 6 hours a week, over the twelve-week term.\nStudents feedback Student A The best prof I’ve had so far at Queen’s, which is high praise because I had some pretty great profs in first year. You’re so well organized and communicate all the concepts so thoroughly. The lectures themselves are enough for me to grasp the material as you always give explanations for why certain assumptions are made, why fluids exhibit certain behaviours, etc. If I had any further questions, I always feel comfortable coming to ask you. You’re very approachable and seem like you care about your students’ success. I find your class to be one of the easiest ones I have right now, but that’s purely because of how well you teach it and how engaged I am in your lectures.\nStudent B Definitely my favourite professor this year. Articulate, clear and concise, and very engaging during lectures. I firmly believe that without the Francesco’s teaching style, I would find the content in this course significantly harder than I do now. It is clear he cares about the students in his class as well; I was surprised to learn he remembered my name when he greeted me at a lecture, when I had told him it only once a couple of weeks ago. I only have positive things to say about my experience with the professor for this class.\nStudent C Francesco is one of the most approachable and understanding professors, and I really appreciate this. He explains content in a very clear way, makes notes available, and provides practice problems with carefully worked and explained solutions.\n","date":1725926400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1725926400,"objectID":"d0a8c4c24cccf9e2017996ceb5ec784e","permalink":"https://FrancescoAmbrogi.github.io/courses/mren241-qu/","publishdate":"2024-09-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/mren241-qu/","section":"courses","summary":"A second year undergraduate engineering course on the fundamentals of Fluid Mechanics for mechatronics engineers.","tags":["previous"],"title":"MREN241 - Fluid Mechanics and Fluid Power - Queen's University","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Table of Contents What you will learn Instructor Pre-requisite knowledge Course materials Suggested time commitment Students feedback What you will learn A continuation of MECH 230 (Applied thermodynamics I) with selected topics such as gas and vapour power cycles, refrigeration, mixtures of gases and vapours, combustion, and available energy.

I have never ever in my life left a review for any prof. I never thought I would find myself loving thermodynamics, but here I am. I genuinely want to attend all his lectures and am engaged throughout. He’s incredible, a great professor, charismatic, caring, he learned my name and he learns everyone’s name. Best prof I ever had.\nStudent B Franceso is one of my favourite instructors here at Queen’s. It is evident that he is passionate about the topic and ensuring that students really understand what he is teaching. Franceso is very approachable and I would not hesitate to ask him any questions. I feel I do better with this topic because he is the instructor.\nStudent C Francesco has been my favourite instructor I have had in my 3 years at Queen’s.

Some other classes moods feel very monotone where I would not be excited to attend class but it was not the case for this class where I would actually look forward to attending class. Instructor was also very open to helping students and I was never discouraged against asking for help.\nStudent B Coming in to this course I was dreading it, I thought it was going to be extremely difficult and I would hate having a course where the sum of all forces does not equal zero but with him fluids was cool and fun an I genuinely looked forward to coming to class and learning new things.\nStudent C The way the course notes are built in front of us and then posted to Moodle is very useful because It keeps us engaged during class, but if you miss class it is easy to catch up on material. The ratio of tutorial to lecture was good. We went over a lot of examples in class which was helpful. Most times, the instructor put emphasis on what was important by starting lectures with a review of the concepts seen in the previous lecture.

He was very accommodating and his passion for the subject made me want to learn more, something no other Queen’s professor has accomplished. He inspired me to switch out of biomechanical and into general mechanical so that I can take fluids again next year. I hope he continues to teach fluids so that MECH 241 doesn’t have to be the class everyone is scared of failing.\nStudent B Honestly hearing it was your first year I didn’t know what to expect, especially hearing what happened in this class. But let me tell you, YOU’VE BEEN AMAZING. Seriously, I was really concerned about the course but the way you deliver materiel is insane. Please become a permanent professor. You’re a god at what you do.\nStudent C Professor Ambrogi is single handedly the best professor and one of the best teachers I have had in my learning career.

Instructor Why you should use Vim? Quitting Vim, not an intuitive task Give Vim a new look Four VIM modes The 5 basics Vim commands to get by What is Vim? Vim (Vi IMproved) is a completely free, open-source, screen-based text editor developed by Bram Moolenaar.\nInstructor Francesco Ambrogi, PhD Why you should use Vim? If you work/study in computational science, chances are you will need to perform numerical simulations on large super-computers by accessing them through Secure SHell connection. Most clusters use Linux as the main operating system and once you are connected to the cluster you will quickly realize that:\nThere is NO graphic interface (in most cases), and all you will see is a terminal window. You will not be able to use your favourite text editor in graphic mode. Do not dispair! Vim is here to save your life. Vim is, by default, present in almost all Linux distributions. Type vim on your command line, and this is the output you should see:\nThe first thing you will realize is that the vim welcome message pops up in the terminal window itself and that, from now on, you can take your mouse (or trackpad) and throw it in the garbage! You might not see it right now, but this is one of the hidden beauties of Vim.\nQuitting Vim, not an intuitive task Everyone who uses Vim on a daily basis has probably done this joke at least once: go to your mother (or best joke buddy), put them in front of an open Vim screen, and ask them a simple question “Please, can you quit?”. After a few seconds you will see the desperation in their eyes, not knowing what is going on, and 98% of the cases they will end up closing the terminal which will kill the entire process.\nAfter this fun intro, here is how you quit Vim: press :q (colomn followed by q)\nGive Vim a new look Right off the bat you might think Vim looks pretty boring, especially if compared with recent very fancy text editors (e.g. Atom, VS code, etc.). To give you an idea, here is a simple function (witten in Julia) to calculate the volume of a spehere:\nIf you are ready to give up Vim because of its look (at first), I totally understand. However, let’s not judge the book from its cover, and take a look at this:\nMuch better, right?? We have now highlighted syntax for different programming languages, we have line numbers, automatic indentation, and it underlines where you currently are with the cursor (which in Vim is pretty crucial). So how do you make these changes in Vim? Again, this is not intuitive. There is no dropdown settings menu where you can edit all the perks.\nAt start-up vim automatically reads a config file called vimrc. This is the equivalent of your bashrc file for your terminal. If you just installed Vim or if you are a brand new user, chances are you do not have this file, so the first thing to do is to create the file at home: touch ~/.vimrc\nInside this file you can now put all your precious settings to make Vim look very fancy, probably even better than mine. Here is a selection of settings which I believe will be useful for any Vim user:\nset nocompatible filetype on filetype indent on syntax on set number set cursorline From top to bottom: nocompatible fixes compatibility problems between Vi and Vim, filetype on makes sure Vim recognizes the file by the extension and syntax, indent on follows indentation rules set by the given programming language, syntax on highlights keywords and functions based on the given programming language, set number put the line number on the left side, and set cursorline underlines the location where the cursor is.\nFour VIM modes The most important thing to realize as soon as Vim starts up is understand in what mode is working. There are 4 MAIN modes:\nNormal: normal mode is the default start-up mode for Vim. This mode is read-only and you will be unable to edit the file. Very useful when consulting or studying a piece of code. Insert: upon pressing i you will enter insert mode. In this mode you will be able to freerly edit the file. Insert mode can also be activated by pressing INS on a full-size keyboard. Two very useful sub-commands are: a will turn on instert mode and move the cursor after the current character. o will turn on insert mode and move the cursor one line below. Visual: this mode allows you to visually highlight (slect) text areas and perform operation (cut, copy, move) on them. Press v to enter visual mode which will mark the beginning of the selection. You can use the arrow keys to highlight the desired text. Command line: this mode will allow you to perform operations such as: quit, save, replace, and search. Enter the command line mode by typing : within normal mode. Example: let’s take the piece of code shown before, and let’s highlight only the formula for the volume of the sphere. You would put the cursor on that line, then press v and move the cursor to the next line pressing ↓. Here is the result:\nThe golden rule: if you do not know in which mode you are in, or …","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"570aa622ff645039e0f5187fac56a3e5","permalink":"https://FrancescoAmbrogi.github.io/courses/my-vim-course/","publishdate":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/my-vim-course/","section":"courses","summary":"A quick introductory course on the hidden beauties of Vim text editor","tags":["previous"],"title":"VIM is awesome","type":"book"},{"authors":["F.

Whereas in Case A the freestream-velocity profile changes from suction–blowing to blowing–suction in a complete cycle, Cases B and C are both suction–blowing only and the strength of the adverse pressure gradient is modulated in time. Moreover, the boundary layer in Case B never approaches a zero-pressure gradient condition. A closed separation bubble is formed for all Cases; however, its dimensions change depending on the far-field forcing. The time evolution of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) reveals an advection mechanism of turbulent structures out of the domain for all Cases. Whereas in Case A and C the high-TKE region, generated in the separated shear layer, is washed out of the domain as a rigid body, in Case B the separation bubble remains present and the advection mechanism of TKE is characterized by a breathing pattern.","tags":["turbulence"],"title":"Influence of Time-Varying Freestream Conditions on the Dynamics of Unsteady Boundary-Layer Separation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Overview During the Winter term 2024 I took on this amazing opportunity at the University of Waterloo: develop an open-source, hands-on, completely asynchronous course with the objective to bridge the gap between small sclae CFD simulations and large-scale computations on high-performance computing (HPC) systems.\nAdvanced Research Computing for Computational Fluid Dynamics, or ARC4CFD, is a 16-hour online, asynchronous course to help learners with a basic understanding of fluid dynamics and CFD bridge the knowledge gap towards the effective utilization of CFD on modern ARC resources.\nTarget audience new graduate students in computational physics or engineering experimentalist and theoreticians complementing their work with numerical simulations on HPC undergraduate students on student design teams interested in leveraging CFD on HPC The prerequisites for the course are listed here.\nLearning outcomes At the end of this course, the learner should be able to:\nDefine the main concepts in parallel and high performance computing Conduct an a priori estimate of the computational cost of a CFD simulation Explain the impact of modelling assumptions on HPC cost Optimize simulation and parameters of a CFD problem for HPC Develop a research data management strategy for a CFD workflow Citation Please cite our manuscript “Advanced Research Computing for Computational Fluid Dynamics (ARC4CFD)”, Hickey et al.

Turbulence models for the steady or unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations (RANS and URANS, respectively) are commonly used in industry; however, their performance is often unsatisfactory. The comparison of RANS results with experimental data does not clearly isolate the modelling errors, since differences with the data may be due to a combination of modelling and numerical errors, and also to possible differences in the boundary conditions.  In the present study we us high-fidelity Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) results to carry out a consistent evaluation of the turbulence models.  By using the same numerical scheme and boundary conditions as the LES, and a grid on which grid convergence was achieved, we can isolate modelling erors. The calculations (both LES and RANS) are carried out using a well-validated, second-order accurate code. Separation is generated by imposing a freestream velocity distribution, that is modulated in time.  We examined three frequencies (a rapid, flutter-like oscillations, an intermediate one in which the forcing and the flow have the same timescales, and a quasi-steady one).  We also considered three different pressure distributions, one with alternating Favourable and Adverse Pressure Gradients (FPG and APG, respectively), one oscillating between an APG and a zero-pressure gradient (ZPG) and one with an oscillating APG.}  All turbulence models capture the general features of this complex unsteady flow as well or better than in similar steady cases. The presence, during the cycle, of times in which the freestream pressure gradient is close to zero affects significantly the model performance. Comparing our results with those in the literature indicates that numerical errors due to the type of discretization and to the grid resolution are as significant as those due to the turbulence model.","tags":["turbulence"],"title":"Evaluation of Turbulence Models in Unsteady Separation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["F.

The unsteadiness was generated by imposing an oscillating, wall-normal velocity profile at the top of the computational domain, and a range of reduced frequencies ($k$), from a very rapid flutter-like motion to a slow quasi-steady oscillation, was studied. Ambrogi et al. [J. Fluid Mech. 945, A10, 2022] showed that the reduced frequency greatly affects the transient separation process, and at a frequency $k = 1$, the separation region became unstable and was advected periodically out of the domain. In this paper we will discuss the causes of the observed advection process and the effects of the unsteadiness on the second moments. The time evolution of turbulent kinetic energy, for instance, reveals that an advection-like phenomenon is also present at a very low reduced frequency, but its dynamic behaviour is completely different from that of the intermediate frequency ($k = 1$). At the intermediate frequency the entire recirculation region is advected downstream, keeping its shape. The advected structure is rotational in nature, and moves at constant speed. In contrast, in the low- frequency case the advected fluid originates at the reattachment point, and the structure is shear-dominated. Particle pathlines reflect the fact that the flow at the low frequency is quasi-steady-state, but show peculiar differences at the intermediate frequency, in which the flow response to the freestream forcing depends on the particle positions in the wall-normal direction.","tags":["turbulence"],"title":"Characterization of unsteady separation in a turbulent boundary layer: Reynolds stresses and flow dynamics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Francesco Ambrogi, PhD"],"categories":["Rotaract"],"content":"Overview My journey in Rotaract in Canada begun on April 2021 when I joined the Rotaract Club of Kingston as a regular member.

The unsteadiness is prescribed by imposing an oscillating suction–blowing velocity profile at the top boundary of the computational domain. The alternating favourable and adverse pressure gradients cause the flow to separate and reattach to the wall periodically. A range of reduced frequencies $k$ was investigated, spanning from a very rapid flutter-like motion to a slow, quasi-steady flapping. The Reynolds number based on the boundary-layer displacement thickness $\\delta_o^\\star$ at the inflow plane is $Re^\\star=1000$. Both time- and phase-averaged fields are analysed and results are compared with steady conditions. The reduced frequency $k$ has a significant effect on the transient flow-separation process. For high $k$ the separation bubble does not grow as thick as in the corresponding steady case, but the length of the bubble remains comparable; hysteresis is observed in the near-wall region. As $k$ is reduced, a threshold is met at which the separation bubble grows in the wall-normal direction. However, the length of the bubble is significantly reduced again when compared with the steady case. At this frequency, the region of slow-moving fluid generated by the flow reversal is advected downstream, causing a decorrelation between the forcing (the imposed free-stream velocity) and the velocity and pressure downstream of the separation bubble. Moreover, hysteresis effects are shifted away from the wall. At the lowest frequency a quasi-steady solution is approached; however, transient effects are still present in the backflow region.","tags":["turbulence"],"title":"Characterization of unsteady separation in a turbulent boundary layer: mean and phase-averaged flow","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Francesco Ambrogi, PhD"],"categories":["University"],"content":"Overview Presented on an annual basis, this award recognizes a teaching assistant of Mechanical Engineering for their contribution to the undergraduate class as voted by all years (2nd , 3rd and 4th ).\nI want to extend my profound gratitude to my wife Veronica, who has the courage to stand by my side every single day, to everyone in the Department, including my supervisor Prof. Piomelli and my fellow colleagues at the TSM-Lab, and to every instructor I have had the pleasure to work with.\n","date":1657670400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1657670400,"objectID":"4c1e813bba1809760e11303698e26a94","permalink":"https://FrancescoAmbrogi.github.io/post/bwa_award/","publishdate":"2022-07-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/bwa_award/","section":"post","summary":"On May 2022 I received the 2022 Bronze Wrench award.","tags":["Academic"],"title":"I was awarded the 2022 Bronze Wrench Award by the MME Department.","type":"post"},{"authors":["Francesco Ambrogi, PhD","Ugo Piomelli","David E.

On an airfoil, for instance, the variation of angle of attack induces unsteadiness in the pressure gradient which greatly affects the flow physics and the airfoil behavior. The fast-changing body curvature of a shark swimming and maneuvering generates strong pressure gradients which, of course, are space and time dependent. Numerical simulation of such case studies is extremely important to increase our physical understanding of separated flows and improve future modeling capabilities.\nIn the present project, the large eddy simulation (LES) technique is used to investigate a turbulent boundary layer under unsteady pressure gradient generated by imposing a suction-blowing velocity profile at the top boundary. The adverse pressure gradient is strong enough to generate a separated flow. The non dimensional parameter which characterizes the unsteadiness is the reduced frequency $\\widetilde{k}$ defined as:\n$$ \\widetilde{k} = \\frac{\\pi f L_{PG}}{U_{o}} $$\nWhere $f$ is the imposed frequency, $L_{PG}$ is the length over which the Pressure Gradient varies, and $U_{o}$ is the free-stream velocity at the inflow plane. Several cases have been investigated over a range of reduced frequency and compared with the steady cases at the same pressure gradient.\nSimulations are performed using a well validated code, with second order differences for all terms, semi-implicit time advancement, and MPI parallelization. The unresolved stresses are modeled using the Vreman eddy viscosity model.\nThe animation shows contours of the instantaneous streamwise velocity $u$ for a reduced frequency of 10, 1 and 0.2 respectively. The animation clearly shows the differences between the two cases: when f is high enough the separation bubble does not have time to develop, yet the size of the separation region is comparable to a steady case.

Day by day I am unlocking new physical and mathematical features of turbulent flows that make this problem scary and fascinating at the same time.\nIn the following years I will investigate the physics of turbulent boundary layers under the effect of strong pressure gradients.\n","date":1611014400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1611014400,"objectID":"53729f5d851d7ec393b88f5a671f45a2","permalink":"https://FrancescoAmbrogi.github.io/post/tsm_joined/","publishdate":"2021-01-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/tsm_joined/","section":"post","summary":"Starting September 2019 I joined the TSM Lab at Queen's University as a Research Assistant.","tags":["Academic"],"title":"I joined the Turbulence Simulation and Modelling (TSM) Lab","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\nFeatures Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides Controls Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;) Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne Two Three A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\nclass: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\nOnly the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view Themes black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} Custom CSS Example Let’s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; } Questions?
