Prandtl discovery BL equations Real world application The Blasius solution What is the boundary layer? The concept of Boundary Layer (BL) is crucial in Fluid Dynamics, in fact if the boundary layer would not exist, it would be impossible for the fluid to generate forces on a body. What is the boundary layer in the first place? Let’s consider a uniform flow of velocity $U_\\infty$ that hits a flat plate at $x=0$ as in the figure below:\nFigure 1: Sketch of the streamwise velocity profile over a flat plate.\nLet’s also imagine we have a Pitot probe at position $\\hat{x}$. By moving the Pitot tube from the free stream down towards the wall we can measure the velocity of the fluid with respect to the distance from the plate, and we can order the values in a table:\nDistance (m) Velocity ($u/U_\\infty$) 1 1 0.8 1 … ?? … ?? 0 0 What we observe is that far enough from the flat plate, the velocity is exactly the same as the freestream velocity $U_\\infty$, therefore we can say that the flow does not feel the presence of the wall. However, as we get closer to the wall the velocity will start decreasing. We know that because of the no-slip boundary condition that has to be valid at the wall ($y = 0$). The big question is: what happens between $y = 0.8$ and $y = 0$? We need to have some sort of function to connect these two points, and the boundary layer theory aims exactly at finding this function.\nBy sequentially lowering the position of the Pitot tube, we will reach a point (ex. 0.05m) where $u/U_\\infty = 0.99$. From this point on, the velocity will keep decreasing until $u/U_\\infty = 0.0$ at the wall. The thickness of the fluid layer in which we have the transition between $u/U_\\infty = 0$ to $u/U_\\infty = 0.99$ is defined as $\\delta$, the boundary layer thickness. It is straight forward to think that as we move on the right of the flat plate, the quantity $\\delta$ cannot be constant, we will find a sort of development as shown in the figure below.\nFigure 2: Sketch of the streamwise development of the Boundary Layer.\nAbove the line denoted as $\\delta_{99}$, the velocity is always the free-stream velocity $U_\\infty$, however, below the line the velocity must necessarily smooth until the value $u = 0$ at the wall. Now let us focus on only one section of the boundary layer denoted as $\\hat{x}$ in the figure above. The section is reported in detail in the Figure below:\nFigure 3: Sketch of one section of the Boundary Layer.\nIt is clear now that the concept of boundary layer thickness is a local definition and it varies with the spacial location on the flat plate. Let’s write the equations for an incompressible fluid with constant viscosity:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial\\overline{u}}{\\partial t} + \\overline{u}\\cdot\\nabla\\overline{u} = -\\frac{\\nabla P}{\\rho} + \\frac{\\mu}{\\rho}\\nabla^2\\overline{u} + \\mathcal{F} $$\nIf we now suppose that $\\mathcal{F}$ is only the gravitational acceleration $g$, what is exactly that make the velocity profile to curve in the way pictured in the figure above? We will find out that the reason is: the viscous term. The viscosity which diffuse momentum between fluids layers, at a certain point it will diffuse the information that the wall has a zero ($u = 0$) velocity. Therefore, we might ask ourselves: what if the viscosity is absent? The fluid should never know about the wall, and in fact the profile will look like a uniform one:\nFigure 4: Sketch of the streamwise velocity profile IF viscosity would be absent.\nWithout viscosity, we should have the red velocity profile in the figure above and we would no have the no slip boundary conditions. Now we defined, without doubts, that inside the boundary layer $y \u0026lt; \\delta$ viscosity is indeed very important.\nLet us try to understand the importance of the term $\\mu/\\rho\\nabla^2\\overline{u}$ by plugging in some numbers. For instance, air has a density of about $\\rho_{air}=1.22 kg/m^3$ at a standard pressure of $P_o = 10^5 Pa$ and standard temperature $T_o = 15 ^\\circ C$. The kinematic viscosity is finally $\\mu=1.8\\cdot 10^{-5} N\\cdot s/m^2$. The idea we can develop is: since each term of the equation presented above is multiplied by an unitary coefficient, we will end up having something like this:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial\\overline{u}}{\\partial t} + \\overline{u}\\cdot\\nabla\\overline{u} = -\\frac{\\nabla P}{1.22} + 1.5\\cdot 10^{-5}\\nabla^2\\overline{u} + \\mathcal{F} $$\nWe will be VERY tempted to conclude that the viscous term (multiplied by $1.5\\cdot 10^{-5}$) is actually very small and it can be easily, and reasonably neglected. The temptation is even stronger if we make a comparison with the oscillatory equation. Let’s take the very simple case of spring and mass in a damped system, as represented in the figure below:\nFigure 5: Sketch of damped oscillatory motion.\nThe equation that describes the mechanical system reads as follow:\n$$ M\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + \\mu\\frac{dy}{dt} + ky = 0 $$\nWe also know that the behavior of the system is like …","date":1744675200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1744675200,"objectID":"62cbd583115231f42287be8fbb8ba566","permalink":"https://FrancescoAmbrogi.github.io/courses/my-blayer-course/","publishdate":"2025-04-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/my-blayer-course/","section":"courses","summary":"A deep dive into the most important revolution in fluid mechanics","tags":["previous"],"title":"Boundary layer theory","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Table of Contents What is Linux? Basic UNIX concepts? The SHELL How do I follow this course? Basic SHELL commands Installing new commands Homework Managing files and directories File editing in CLI I/O redirection Bash scripting Conclusion What is Linux? Linux is an operating system that evolved from a kernel created by Linus Torvalds. It evolved from an old UNIX system, but it is important to remember that:\nLinux is not a program Linux is an interface between computer/server hardware and the programs that run on it. People would often say Linux is just a kernel, but it turns out that a kernel is the focal point of any OS. A kernel is literally what tells the big chip what to do with the programs you are using. To make a relatively appealing example, think of a nice plate of pappardelle with wild boar ragu (a typical dish from my home region in Italy). If the dish itself is the operating system, the ingredients (tomato sauce, meat, persley, etc) are the programs that run on it, and the pasta is the kernel. Without pasta the dish completely loses its significance, no matter the quantity of programs that run on it.\nWhy you should use Linux today?\nBelow I will give you my reasons as to why you should consider using Linux. This is beyond being and exhaustive list of reasons, or an absolute list of reasons.\nLinux is FREE and OPEN-SOURCE. You can easily look at its source code, and if you are crazy enough even attempt to mdify it. The open-source characteristic is probably the most beautiful aspect, as over the years, people have contributed to its development. You now have gazillion Linux distributions which you can try and choose from, but most importantly, you have a massive community behind Linux ready to help when you have a problem. AMAZING software mamagement through packages. You can update your systems and your applications WHENEVER you feel like it (unlike other OSs). Linux is stable, very light, and reliable. This is the reason why it is the first choice as OS in Internet Servers, Cloud systems, and Clusters. Linux is safe and transparent. Due to its large community-based developments at its back, Linux is probably the safest OS in terms of malwares and attacks. This does not mean that it is immune! Why you should not use Linux?\nLinux IS NOT very user friendly and it can be confusing for non-tech savy people. The learning curve might be steep at first. Linux has small peripheral hardware drivers compared to windows. If you are a hard-core gamer, Linux is probably not your choice (yet …). If you use Linux regularly you might run into compatibility issues with commonly used programs in corparate offices or companies (MS Word, MS excel, etc). Basic UNIX concepts? It is important, before we dive into the command line, to clarify a few important UNIX concepts:\nFile: data stored in a standard format that behaves in a certain way depending on its function in the system. In Linux (UNIX in general) everything is a file. Program: a file that can be executed (run). Process: a program that is being executed. Ownership: in UNIX sytems files/programs/processes are owned by a user and a group. Hierarchical directory structure: files are organized in directories (you would call them folders) that can have a parent or children. Example: in the path /home/user/sim1/run.sh the file named run.sh is contained in the directory sim1 and user is its parent directory. Managing your files and processes in an organized way is a crucial step in the correct utilization of the system.\nThe SHELL The shell is a program that takes (interpret) commands from the keyboard and gives them to the OS to perform. The shell is a comand line interface (CLI), and it will be the main focus of this short course. The shell provides:\nBuilt-in commands. Programming control structures. Environment variables. Linux supports several shell programs, but the default is usually BASH (Bourne Again SHell).\nThe Terminal is a program called a terminal emulator. This is a program that opens a window and lets you interact with the shell. Once again, there are several terminal emulators supported by Linux systems: gnome-terminal, konsole, xterm, nxterm, and eterm.\nThe Prompt is that first line that pops up when you first open a terminal application. It is very informative, and it might look something like this:\nfrancesco@rafaela : (~) -\u0026gt; This is the prompt of my own device, and most likely yours will look different, but here is what the prompt is telling us (or me in this case):\nUsername: francesco System/computer name: rafaela Current working directory (~). In Linux the symbol ~ is a shorthand for HOME directory. Blinking cursor: the terminal is always waiting for the user input. It usually displays a blinking cursor. The basic syntax to give commands to the Shell is the following:\ncommand [OPTIONS] argument(s) command: is the keyword that identifies the specific command you are trying to run. [OPTIONS]: optional, they add more specifics to the command you are …","date":1743465600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1743465600,"objectID":"dd7e2431dd5d12b51950f55efe22c960","permalink":"https://FrancescoAmbrogi.github.io/courses/my-cli-course/","publishdate":"2025-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/my-cli-course/","section":"courses","summary":"An introductory course on command line interface","tags":["previous"],"title":"Introduction to Command Line Interface","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Table of Contents What you will learn Instructor Pre-requisite knowledge Course materials Suggested time commitment Students feedback What you will learn This course introduces fundamental thermodynamics and heat transfer concepts needed to analyze thermal systems including: ideal gas laws; work and heat; conservation of energy; thermodynamic properties of pure substances; equations of state; applications to open and closed systems; heat transfer by conduction, convection and radiation.

You’re so well organized and communicate all the concepts so thoroughly. The lectures themselves are enough for me to grasp the material as you always give explanations for why certain assumptions are made, why fluids exhibit certain behaviours, etc. If I had any further questions, I always feel comfortable coming to ask you. You’re very approachable and seem like you care about your students’ success. I find your class to be one of the easiest ones I have right now, but that’s purely because of how well you teach it and how engaged I am in your lectures.\nStudent B Definitely my favourite professor this year. Articulate, clear and concise, and very engaging during lectures. I firmly believe that without the Francesco’s teaching style, I would find the content in this course significantly harder than I do now. It is clear he cares about the students in his class as well; I was surprised to learn he remembered my name when he greeted me at a lecture, when I had told him it only once a couple of weeks ago.

If you work/study in computational science, chances are you will need to perform numerical simulations on large super-computers by accessing them through Secure SHell connection. Most clusters use Linux as the main operating system and once you are connected to the cluster you will quickly realize that:\nThere is NO graphic interface (in most cases), and all you will see is a terminal window.

Type vim on your command line, and this is the output you should see:\nThe first thing you will realize is that the vim welcome message pops up in the terminal window itself and that, from now on, you can take your mouse (or trackpad) and throw it in the garbage! You might not see it right now, but this is one of the hidden beauties of Vim.\nQuitting Vim, not an intuitive task Everyone who uses Vim on a daily basis has probably done this joke at least once: go to your mother (or best joke buddy), put them in front of an open Vim screen, and ask them a simple question “Please, can you quit?”. After a few seconds you will see the desperation in their eyes, not knowing what is going on, and 98% of the cases they will end up closing the terminal which will kill the entire process.\nAfter this fun intro, here is how you quit Vim: press :q (colomn followed by q)\nGive Vim a new look Right off the bat you might think Vim looks pretty boring, especially if compared with recent very fancy text editors (e.g. Atom, VS code, etc.). To give you an idea, here is a simple function (witten in Julia) to calculate the volume of a spehere:\nIf you are ready to give up Vim because of its look (at first), I totally understand. However, let’s not judge the book from its cover, and take a look at this:\nMuch better, right?? We have now highlighted syntax for different programming languages, we have line numbers, automatic indentation, and it underlines where you currently are with the cursor (which in Vim is pretty crucial). So how do you make these changes in Vim? Again, this is not intuitive. There is no dropdown settings menu where you can edit all the perks.\nAt start-up vim automatically reads a config file called vimrc. This is the equivalent of your bashrc file for your terminal. If you just installed Vim or if you are a brand new user, chances are you do not have this file, so the first thing to do is to create the file at home: touch ~/.vimrc\nInside this file you can now put all your precious settings to make Vim look very fancy, probably even better than mine. Here is a selection of settings which I believe will be useful for any Vim user:\nset nocompatible filetype on filetype indent on syntax on set number set cursorline From top to bottom: nocompatible fixes compatibility problems between Vi and Vim, filetype on makes sure Vim recognizes the file by the extension and syntax, indent on follows indentation rules set by the given programming language, syntax on highlights keywords and functions based on the given programming language, set number put the line number on the left side, and set cursorline underlines the location where the cursor is.\nFour VIM modes The most important thing to realize as soon as Vim starts up is understand in what mode is working. There are 4 MAIN modes:\nNormal: normal mode is the default start-up mode for Vim. This mode is read-only and you will be unable to edit the file. Very useful when consulting or studying a piece of code. Insert: upon pressing i you will enter insert mode. In this mode you will be able to freerly edit the file. Insert mode can also be activated by pressing INS on a full-size keyboard. Two very useful sub-commands are: a will turn on instert mode and move the cursor after the current character. o will turn on insert mode and move the cursor one line below. Visual: this mode allows you to visually highlight (slect) text areas and perform operation (cut, copy, move) on them. Press v to enter visual mode which will mark the beginning of the selection. You can use the arrow keys to highlight the desired text. Command line: this mode will allow you to perform operations such as: quit, save, replace, and search. Enter the command line mode by typing : within normal mode. Example: let’s take the piece of code shown before, and let’s highlight only the formula for the volume of the sphere. You would put the cursor on that line, then press v and move the cursor to the next line pressing ↓. Here is the result:\nThe golden rule: if you do not know in which mode you are in, or if …","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"570aa622ff645039e0f5187fac56a3e5","permalink":"https://FrancescoAmbrogi.github.io/courses/my-vim-course/","publishdate":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/my-vim-course/","section":"courses","summary":"A quick introductory course on the hidden beauties of Vim text editor","tags":["previous"],"title":"VIM is awesome","type":"book"},{"authors":["Dr. Ambrogi Francesco"],"categories":["University"],"content":"Overview On April 6th 2025 I had the pleasure of attending the 2025 Engineering Society banquet, and I absolutely loved it. I should clarify that this event was entirely organized, planned, and ran by students, and it was WONDERFUL. During the night more than 20 awards were presented to students and faculty members that made a significant impact on the Queen’s community. The amount of appreciation and care that students have for one another at this university is truly moving, and something I have never seen anywhere else. It was just beautiful to witness, and this is the reason I LOVE working in this institution.\nThe Golden Apple was created in December of 1970 by the Engineering Society Development Committee as a means for undergraduate students to honor faculty members. I was nominated for the Golden Apple award by a student (Ian) who made a speech I will hardly forget. Here it is:\nThere are professors who teach the material—and then there are professors who make students feel truly seen. This one brings a remarkable energy to every lecture, delivering thermodynamics and fluid mechanics concepts with clarity, passion, and a spark that makes learning feel exciting.\nThey take the time to get to know their students, learning names and checking in—not just academically, but personally. They regularly gather feedback and, more impressively, act on it—always looking for ways to make their courses better.\nTheir care extends beyond the classroom. Whether it’s asking how the week is going, attending the Tron hockey game with their family, or hanging out in student spaces, they make it clear that students matter.\nThey lead with humility, warmth, and a deep respect for their students—never putting themselves on a pedestal, and always creating a space where students feel comfortable and supported.\nFor their energy in the classroom, their compassion outside of it, their commitment to student growth, and their unwavering dedication to making engineering education better every single day—it is with deep appreciation and admiration that I present the Golden Apple Award to Francesco Ambrogi.\nIan’s words means everything to me, and they are probably more important than the Award itself. I became a professor today because about 7 years ago another professor made an impact on my academic and learning journey. My biggest dream is to do the same to the new generations of leaders, engineers, and young professionals, and Ian’s words made me realize I might just be on the right track!\nThanks everyone!\n","date":1743897600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1743897600,"objectID":"0de3cc84dfe4249d53c4f61ee69960fe","permalink":"https://FrancescoAmbrogi.github.io/post/gaa_25/","publishdate":"2025-04-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/gaa_25/","section":"post","summary":"On April 2025 I received the Golden Apple Award..","tags":["Academic"],"title":"I received the 2025 Golden Apple Award.","type":"post"},{"authors":["Dr. Ambrogi Francesco"],"categories":["University"],"content":"Overview About the speakers Gianmarco D\u0026#39;Alessandro: Gianmarco earned his PhD from Queen\u0026#39;s University where he worked as a graduate research assistant in Prof. Piomelli\u0026#39;s group.

Whereas in Case A the freestream-velocity profile changes from suction–blowing to blowing–suction in a complete cycle, Cases B and C are both suction–blowing only and the strength of the adverse pressure gradient is modulated in time. Moreover, the boundary layer in Case B never approaches a zero-pressure gradient condition. A closed separation bubble is formed for all Cases; however, its dimensions change depending on the far-field forcing. The time evolution of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) reveals an advection mechanism of turbulent structures out of the domain for all Cases. Whereas in Case A and C the high-TKE region, generated in the separated shear layer, is washed out of the domain as a rigid body, in Case B the separation bubble remains present and the advection mechanism of TKE is characterized by a breathing pattern.","tags":["turbulence"],"title":"Influence of Time-Varying Freestream Conditions on the Dynamics of Unsteady Boundary-Layer Separation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Overview During the Winter term 2024 I took on this amazing opportunity at the University of Waterloo: develop an open-source, hands-on, completely asynchronous course with the objective to bridge the gap between small sclae CFD simulations and large-scale computations on high-performance computing (HPC) systems.\nAdvanced Research Computing for Computational Fluid Dynamics, or ARC4CFD, is a 16-hour online, asynchronous course to help learners with a basic understanding of fluid dynamics and CFD bridge the knowledge gap towards the effective utilization of CFD on modern ARC resources.\nTarget audience new graduate students in computational physics or engineering experimentalist and theoreticians complementing their work with numerical simulations on HPC undergraduate students on student design teams interested in leveraging CFD on HPC The prerequisites for the course are listed here.\nLearning outcomes At the end of this course, the learner should be able to:\nDefine the main concepts in parallel and high performance computing Conduct an a priori estimate of the computational cost of a CFD simulation Explain the impact of modelling assumptions on HPC cost Optimize simulation and parameters of a CFD problem for HPC Develop a research data management strategy for a CFD workflow Citation Please cite our manuscript “Advanced Research Computing for Computational Fluid Dynamics (ARC4CFD)”, Hickey et al.

Turbulence models for the steady or unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations (RANS and URANS, respectively) are commonly used in industry; however, their performance is often unsatisfactory. The comparison of RANS results with experimental data does not clearly isolate the modelling errors, since differences with the data may be due to a combination of modelling and numerical errors, and also to possible differences in the boundary conditions.  In the present study we us high-fidelity Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) results to carry out a consistent evaluation of the turbulence models.  By using the same numerical scheme and boundary conditions as the LES, and a grid on which grid convergence was achieved, we can isolate modelling erors. The calculations (both LES and RANS) are carried out using a well-validated, second-order accurate code. Separation is generated by imposing a freestream velocity distribution, that is modulated in time.  We examined three frequencies (a rapid, flutter-like oscillations, an intermediate one in which the forcing and the flow have the same timescales, and a quasi-steady one).  We also considered three different pressure distributions, one with alternating Favourable and Adverse Pressure Gradients (FPG and APG, respectively), one oscillating between an APG and a zero-pressure gradient (ZPG) and one with an oscillating APG.}  All turbulence models capture the general features of this complex unsteady flow as well or better than in similar steady cases. The presence, during the cycle, of times in which the freestream pressure gradient is close to zero affects significantly the model performance. Comparing our results with those in the literature indicates that numerical errors due to the type of discretization and to the grid resolution are as significant as those due to the turbulence model.","tags":["turbulence"],"title":"Evaluation of Turbulence Models in Unsteady Separation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["F.

The unsteadiness was generated by imposing an oscillating, wall-normal velocity profile at the top of the computational domain, and a range of reduced frequencies ($k$), from a very rapid flutter-like motion to a slow quasi-steady oscillation, was studied. Ambrogi et al. [J. Fluid Mech. 945, A10, 2022] showed that the reduced frequency greatly affects the transient separation process, and at a frequency $k = 1$, the separation region became unstable and was advected periodically out of the domain. In this paper we will discuss the causes of the observed advection process and the effects of the unsteadiness on the second moments. The time evolution of turbulent kinetic energy, for instance, reveals that an advection-like phenomenon is also present at a very low reduced frequency, but its dynamic behaviour is completely different from that of the intermediate frequency ($k = 1$). At the intermediate frequency the entire recirculation region is advected downstream, keeping its shape. The advected structure is rotational in nature, and moves at constant speed. In contrast, in the low- frequency case the advected fluid originates at the reattachment point, and the structure is shear-dominated. Particle pathlines reflect the fact that the flow at the low frequency is quasi-steady-state, but show peculiar differences at the intermediate frequency, in which the flow response to the freestream forcing depends on the particle positions in the wall-normal direction.","tags":["turbulence"],"title":"Characterization of unsteady separation in a turbulent boundary layer: Reynolds stresses and flow dynamics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dr. Ambrogi Francesco"],"categories":["Rotaract"],"content":"Overview My journey in Rotaract in Canada begun on April 2021 when I joined the Rotaract Club of Kingston as a regular member.

The unsteadiness is prescribed by imposing an oscillating suction–blowing velocity profile at the top boundary of the computational domain. The alternating favourable and adverse pressure gradients cause the flow to separate and reattach to the wall periodically. A range of reduced frequencies $k$ was investigated, spanning from a very rapid flutter-like motion to a slow, quasi-steady flapping. The Reynolds number based on the boundary-layer displacement thickness $\\delta_o^\\star$ at the inflow plane is $Re^\\star=1000$. Both time- and phase-averaged fields are analysed and results are compared with steady conditions. The reduced frequency $k$ has a significant effect on the transient flow-separation process. For high $k$ the separation bubble does not grow as thick as in the corresponding steady case, but the length of the bubble remains comparable; hysteresis is observed in the near-wall region. As $k$ is reduced, a threshold is met at which the separation bubble grows in the wall-normal direction. However, the length of the bubble is significantly reduced again when compared with the steady case. At this frequency, the region of slow-moving fluid generated by the flow reversal is advected downstream, causing a decorrelation between the forcing (the imposed free-stream velocity) and the velocity and pressure downstream of the separation bubble. Moreover, hysteresis effects are shifted away from the wall. At the lowest frequency a quasi-steady solution is approached; however, transient effects are still present in the backflow region.","tags":["turbulence"],"title":"Characterization of unsteady separation in a turbulent boundary layer: mean and phase-averaged flow","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dr. Ambrogi Francesco"],"categories":["University"],"content":"Overview Presented on an annual basis, this award recognizes a teaching assistant of Mechanical Engineering for their contribution to the undergraduate class as voted by all years (2nd , 3rd and 4th ).\nI want to extend my profound gratitude to my wife Veronica, who has the courage to stand by my side every single day, to everyone in the Department, including my supervisor Prof. Piomelli and my fellow colleagues at the TSM-Lab, and to every instructor I have had the pleasure to work with.\n","date":1657670400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1657670400,"objectID":"4c1e813bba1809760e11303698e26a94","permalink":"https://FrancescoAmbrogi.github.io/post/bwa_award/","publishdate":"2022-07-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/bwa_award/","section":"post","summary":"On May 2022 I received the 2022 Bronze Wrench award.","tags":["Academic"],"title":"I was awarded the 2022 Bronze Wrench Award by the MME Department.","type":"post"},{"authors":["Dr. Ambrogi Francesco","Ugo Piomelli","David E.

On an airfoil, for instance, the variation of angle of attack induces unsteadiness in the pressure gradient which greatly affects the flow physics and the airfoil behavior. The fast-changing body curvature of a shark swimming and maneuvering generates strong pressure gradients which, of course, are space and time dependent. Numerical simulation of such case studies is extremely important to increase our physical understanding of separated flows and improve future modeling capabilities.\nIn the present project, the large eddy simulation (LES) technique is used to investigate a turbulent boundary layer under unsteady pressure gradient generated by imposing a suction-blowing velocity profile at the top boundary. The adverse pressure gradient is strong enough to generate a separated flow. The non dimensional parameter which characterizes the unsteadiness is the reduced frequency $\\widetilde{k}$ defined as:\n$$ \\widetilde{k} = \\frac{\\pi f L_{PG}}{U_{o}} $$\nWhere $f$ is the imposed frequency, $L_{PG}$ is the length over which the Pressure Gradient varies, and $U_{o}$ is the free-stream velocity at the inflow plane. Several cases have been investigated over a range of reduced frequency and compared with the steady cases at the same pressure gradient.\nSimulations are performed using a well validated code, with second order differences for all terms, semi-implicit time advancement, and MPI parallelization. The unresolved stresses are modeled using the Vreman eddy viscosity model.\nThe animation shows contours of the instantaneous streamwise velocity $u$ for a reduced frequency of 10, 1 and 0.2 respectively. The animation clearly shows the differences between the two cases: when f is high enough the separation bubble does not have time to develop, yet the size of the separation region is comparable to a steady case. When $k$ decreases, the extent of the separation bubble in the wall normal direction increases but the length of the separation region is reduced compared with the steady case.\n","date":1628899200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628899200,"objectID":"ddc8498dab1c9182f3d975cd20184cd8","permalink":"https://FrancescoAmbrogi.github.io/project/uapgtbl/","publishdate":"2021-08-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/uapgtbl/","section":"project","summary":"Unsteady Pressure Gradient Turbulent Boundary Layer Simulation","tags":["Turbulence"],"title":"UAPG-TBL Simulation","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1618704000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618704000,"objectID":"4be912806a7293f8db77645774c5f0b9","permalink":"https://FrancescoAmbrogi.github.io/project/pyn/","publishdate":"2021-04-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/pyn/","section":"project","summary":"An undergraduate level set of Numerical Analysis problems using Python.
