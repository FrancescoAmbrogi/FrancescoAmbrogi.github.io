The main goal is to give students a basic understanding of fluid mechanics principles and their application to the design and analysis of practical engineering systems. Upon completion of the course students will be able to:\nDefine a fluid based on its thermodynamic properties. Distinguish between a Eulerian and a Lagrangian approach to fluid mechanics. Compute pressure distribution and forces on submerged bodies in a static fluid. Handle flow problems in an integral framework using the conservation of mass and momentum. Understand the relevance of dimensional analysis and non-dimensional groups. Use Bernoulli’s equation to solve simple flow problems involving Pitot probes and Bernoulli’s obstacles. Solve simple flow fields using the Navier-Stokes system of equations with appropriate assumptions and boundary conditions. Solve pipe flow problems and piping systems involving pumps, minor and major losses. Instructor Francesco Ambrogi Pre-requisite knowledge This course is a requirement for all second year Mechanical and Materials Engineering students at Queen’s University. This course is designed for learners who have successfully completed the first-year program in engineering and a course in differential equations. Learners must have completed the prerequisite course (APSC 111 - Physics) or a similar course.\nCourse materials Download the Course Syllabus HERE\nRequired textbook: Fluid Mechanics, Ninth Edition, F. White (McGraw Hill)\nSuggested time commitment Generally, we expect that students attend all lectures (3hrs/week), review material at home (1 hr/week), complete the weekly assignment problems (1-2 hrs/week - if an assignment takes much more than 1 hr you should be doing additional problems and coming to tutorials and office hours for additional help understanding, about another 2 hours a week). If you keep up your understanding week to week, then a few hours review should be enough to do well on the final exam. An average student will be able to do well in this course by spending about 6 hours a week, over the twelve-week term.\nFAQs Are there prerequisites? The only ones I could think of are: a basic knowledge of Calculus and Physics.\nIs there a lot of math? There is a REASONABLE amount of math. However, nothing you can’t handle!\nDo I need to memorize a lot? You DO NOT. The equations you must remember are very few and very simple. I will always allow students to take the exam with a single-sided or double-sided formula sheet.\n","date":1683936000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1683936000,"objectID":"46b719e4bdf6302d0e7fba09938722a7","permalink":"https://FrancescoAmbrogi.github.io/courses/fluidsi/","publishdate":"2023-05-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/fluidsi/","section":"courses","summary":"A second year engineering course on the fundamentals of Fluid Mechanics","tags":["previous"],"title":"Fluid Mechanics I","type":"book"},{"authors":["F.

Covid-19 had a very bad impact on our Club, which at that time had only 4 active members. I decided the focus of my year to be “giving help to all new comers to Kingston” with a particular enphasis on families coming from countries with geopolitical issues, or refugees from Syria and Ukraine. I started a fruitful collaboration with the Newcomer center at KEYS in Kingston, and we organized several fundraisers and events to support newcomers and refugess in our community (for more details check our website). All these activities generated interest in many youg professionals and graduate students and our Club went from 4 active members to more than 10. On a District level, I became part of the committee in charge of organizing the Rotary District Conference for 2024 during DG Pardeep year (check the DisCon24 website).\nAs of July 2023 I was appointed Assistant Governor Rotaract and I will have the priviledge to work with the district leadership to ensure Rotaract and Rotaractors thrive in our District.

The unsteadiness is prescribed by imposing an oscillating suction–blowing velocity profile at the top boundary of the computational domain. The alternating favourable and adverse pressure gradients cause the flow to separate and reattach to the wall periodically. A range of reduced frequencies $k$ was investigated, spanning from a very rapid flutter-like motion to a slow, quasi-steady flapping. The Reynolds number based on the boundary-layer displacement thickness $\\delta_o^\\star$ at the inflow plane is $Re^\\star=1000$. Both time- and phase-averaged fields are analysed and results are compared with steady conditions. The reduced frequency $k$ has a significant effect on the transient flow-separation process. For high $k$ the separation bubble does not grow as thick as in the corresponding steady case, but the length of the bubble remains comparable; hysteresis is observed in the near-wall region. As $k$ is reduced, a threshold is met at which the separation bubble grows in the wall-normal direction. However, the length of the bubble is significantly reduced again when compared with the steady case. At this frequency, the region of slow-moving fluid generated by the flow reversal is advected downstream, causing a decorrelation between the forcing (the imposed free-stream velocity) and the velocity and pressure downstream of the separation bubble. Moreover, hysteresis effects are shifted away from the wall. At the lowest frequency a quasi-steady solution is approached; however, transient effects are still present in the backflow region.","tags":["turbulence"],"title":"Characterization of unsteady separation in a turbulent boundary layer: mean and phase-averaged flow","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Francesco Ambrogi"],"categories":["University"],"content":"Overview Presented on an annual basis, this award recognizes a teaching assistant of Mechanical Engineering for their contribution to the undergraduate class as voted by all years (2nd , 3rd and 4th ).\nI want to extend my profound gratitude to my wife Veronica, who has the courage to stand by my side every single day, to everyone in the Department, including my supervisor Prof. Piomelli and my fellow colleagues at the TSM-Lab, and to every instructor I have had the pleasure to work with.\n","date":1657670400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1657670400,"objectID":"4c1e813bba1809760e11303698e26a94","permalink":"https://FrancescoAmbrogi.github.io/post/bwa_award/","publishdate":"2022-07-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/bwa_award/","section":"post","summary":"On May 2022 I received the 2022 Bronze Wrench award.","tags":["Academic"],"title":"I was awarded the 2022 Bronze Wrench Award by the MME Department.","type":"post"},{"authors":["Francesco Ambrogi","Ugo Piomelli","David E.

On an airfoil, for instance, the variation of angle of attack induces unsteadiness in the pressure gradient which greatly affects the flow physics and the airfoil behavior. The fast-changing body curvature of a shark swimming and maneuvering generates strong pressure gradients which, of course, are space and time dependent. Numerical simulation of such case studies is extremely important to increase our physical understanding of separated flows and improve future modeling capabilities.\nIn the present project, the large eddy simulation (LES) technique is used to investigate a turbulent boundary layer under unsteady pressure gradient generated by imposing a suction-blowing velocity profile at the top boundary. The adverse pressure gradient is strong enough to generate a separated flow. The non dimensional parameter which characterizes the unsteadiness is the reduced frequency $\\widetilde{k}$ defined as:\n$$ \\widetilde{k} = \\frac{\\pi f L_{PG}}{U_{o}} $$\nWhere $f$ is the imposed frequency, $L_{PG}$ is the length over which the Pressure Gradient varies, and $U_{o}$ is the free-stream velocity at the inflow plane. Several cases have been investigated over a range of reduced frequency and compared with the steady cases at the same pressure gradient.\nSimulations are performed using a well validated code, with second order differences for all terms, semi-implicit time advancement, and MPI parallelization. The unresolved stresses are modeled using the Vreman eddy viscosity model.\nThe animation shows contours of the instantaneous streamwise velocity $u$ for a reduced frequency of 10, 1 and 0.2 respectively. The animation clearly shows the differences between the two cases: when f is high enough the separation bubble does not have time to develop, yet the size of the separation region is comparable to a steady case. When $k$ decreases, the extent of the separation bubble in the wall normal direction increases but the length of the separation region is reduced compared with the steady case.\n","date":1628899200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628899200,"objectID":"ddc8498dab1c9182f3d975cd20184cd8","permalink":"https://FrancescoAmbrogi.github.io/project/uapgtbl/","publishdate":"2021-08-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/uapgtbl/","section":"project","summary":"Unsteady Pressure Gradient Turbulent Boundary Layer Simulation","tags":["Turbulence"],"title":"UAPG-TBL Simulation","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1618704000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618704000,"objectID":"4be912806a7293f8db77645774c5f0b9","permalink":"https://FrancescoAmbrogi.github.io/project/pyn/","publishdate":"2021-04-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/pyn/","section":"project","summary":"An undergraduate level set of Numerical Analysis problems using Python.
