The unsteadiness is prescribed by imposing an oscillating suction–blowing velocity profile at the top boundary of the computational domain. The alternating favourable and adverse pressure gradients cause the flow to separate and reattach to the wall periodically. A range of reduced frequencies $k$ was investigated, spanning from a very rapid flutter-like motion to a slow, quasi-steady flapping. The Reynolds number based on the boundary-layer displacement thickness $\\delta_o^\\star$ at the inflow plane is $Re^\\star=1000$. Both time- and phase-averaged fields are analysed and results are compared with steady conditions. The reduced frequency $k$ has a significant effect on the transient flow-separation process. For high $k$ the separation bubble does not grow as thick as in the corresponding steady case, but the length of the bubble remains comparable; hysteresis is observed in the near-wall region. As $k$ is reduced, a threshold is met at which the separation bubble grows in the wall-normal direction. However, the length of the bubble is significantly reduced again when compared with the steady case. At this frequency, the region of slow-moving fluid generated by the flow reversal is advected downstream, causing a decorrelation between the forcing (the imposed free-stream velocity) and the velocity and pressure downstream of the separation bubble. Moreover, hysteresis effects are shifted away from the wall. At the lowest frequency a quasi-steady solution is approached; however, transient effects are still present in the backflow region.","tags":["turbulence"],"title":"Characterization of unsteady separation in a turbulent boundary layer: mean and phase-averaged flow","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Francesco Ambrogi","Ugo Piomelli","David E.

On an airfoil, for instance, the variation of angle of attack induces unsteadiness in the pressure gradient which greatly affects the flow physics and the airfoil behavior. The fast-changing body curvature of a shark swimming and maneuvering generates strong pressure gradients which, of course, are space and time dependent. Numerical simulation of such case studies is extremely important to increase our physical understanding of separated flows and improve future modeling capabilities.\nIn the present project, the large eddy simulation (LES) technique is used to investigate a turbulent boundary layer under unsteady pressure gradient generated by imposing a suction-blowing velocity profile at the top boundary. The adverse pressure gradient is strong enough to generate a separated flow. The non dimensional parameter which characterizes the unsteadiness is the reduced frequency $\\widetilde{k}$ defined as:\n$$ \\widetilde{k} = \\frac{\\pi f L_{PG}}{U_{o}} $$\nWhere $f$ is the imposed frequency, $L_{PG}$ is the length over which the Pressure Gradient varies, and $U_{o}$ is the free-stream velocity at the inflow plane. Several cases have been investigated over a range of reduced frequency and compared with the steady cases at the same pressure gradient.\nSimulations are performed using a well validated code, with second order differences for all terms, semi-implicit time advancement, and MPI parallelization. The unresolved stresses are modeled using the Vreman eddy viscosity model.\nThe animation shows contours of the instantaneous streamwise velocity $u$ for a reduced frequency of 10, 1 and 0.2 respectively. The animation clearly shows the differences between the two cases: when f is high enough the separation bubble does not have time to develop, yet the size of the separation region is comparable to a steady case. When $k$ decreases, the extent of the separation bubble in the wall normal direction increases but the length of the separation region is reduced compared with the steady case.\n","date":1628899200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628899200,"objectID":"ddc8498dab1c9182f3d975cd20184cd8","permalink":"https://FrancescoAmbrogi.github.io/project/uapgtbl/","publishdate":"2021-08-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/uapgtbl/","section":"project","summary":"Unsteady Pressure Gradient Turbulent Boundary Layer Simulation","tags":["Turbulence"],"title":"UAPG-TBL Simulation","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1618704000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618704000,"objectID":"4be912806a7293f8db77645774c5f0b9","permalink":"https://FrancescoAmbrogi.github.io/project/pyn/","publishdate":"2021-04-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/pyn/","section":"project","summary":"An undergraduate level set of Numerical Analysis problems using Python.
